    <p>
      This repository is a template for building modern, fast, and modular web applications using TypeScript and Web Components, powered by Vite.
    </p>
    <p>
      It features a lightweight client-side router, a component-based architecture with a base class for easy component creation, and a development environment optimized with Vite. The goal is to provide a clean, intuitive, and "bubbly" developer experience.
